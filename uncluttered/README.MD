# Uncluttered
This is the skin I use.

Features:
- Removed What's New from library home
- Removed Home Button from left menu
- Reduced game details header
- Removed Activity Feed
- Rearranged app details components (achievements, friends who play, etc.)
- Spotlight at the bottom instead of at the top (game news, session summaries)
- Disabled rating begger (You've played for X hours, would you like to recomment...)
